The model represents an overlap laser weld with a fault (interruption, gap). Such gaps can't be found by visual inspection, as they look like perfect welds from both sides.

A method to detect such faults is thermographic testing with heat impulse excitation (e.g. by induction, by pressurized air or by flash light).

## Pre-Processing
The geometry consists of four bricks which are independently meshed.

You may edit the file [values.fbl](values.fbl) and then run
```
> cgx -b pre.fbl
```
Thermal contact is established via equations, which essentialy establish tied contact. The equations are generated by CGX using lines of the type
```
send <dep> <indep> abq areampc t
```
## Solving

```
> ccx Naht
```

## Post-Processing

```
> cgx -b post.fbl
```

The command
```
> cgx -b plots.fbl
```
creates
 1. a time history plot at four probe positions and
 2. a temperature profile at t=2s

### Time history plot
The probes are located at the center of the first seam segment and of the fault (gap), on the top (excitation) and on the bottom side. These locations are computed from the geometric parameters of the model.

### Path plot (temperature profile)

The temperature profile along the seam at the top side is plotted. The Path is defined by the node set `top`
